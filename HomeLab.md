# 🏠 Home Lab Setup  

This folder contains my **home network security projects**, configurations, and optimizations.  
I document how I **hardened my home network**, improved security protocols, optimized network performance, and tested cybersecurity tools.  

## 🔹 Projects in This Folder:  

### 🔐 **Home Network Security Hardening (2025)**  
- Secured an **unsecured home network** using industry-standard best practices.  
- Implemented **WPA2-PSK encryption, MAC address filtering, and secure DNS settings**.  
- Configured **firewall rules, network segmentation, and access controls** for better security.  
- Improved **network monitoring, logging, and intrusion detection measures**.  
- Deployed **WiFi extenders to improve coverage** while ensuring **secure configurations, encryption, and access control policies**.  
- **Enabled only necessary uPnP settings** for **seamless gaming** while maintaining security best practices.  
- Activated **5GHz WiFi** for **better performance, reduced interference, and improved security over 2.4GHz**.  

### 🛡 **Firewall & IDS Configurations**  
- Set up a **firewall to restrict unauthorized access** and reduce attack surfaces.  
- Implemented **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for monitoring potential threats**.  
- Strengthened **port management, service restrictions, and outbound filtering** to minimize risks.  

### 📡 **Network Performance & Security Improvements**  
- Tuned **router settings to balance security and gaming performance**.  
- Analyzed **traffic logs for potential vulnerabilities**.  
- Configured **secure DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) settings** to prevent DNS hijacking and improve privacy.  

## 🚀 **Future Additions:**  
✅ **MAC Address Whitelisting** – Restricting network access to **trusted devices only** for added security.  
✅ **Locally Hosted VPN** – Running a self-hosted VPN for **private, encrypted remote access**.  
✅ **URL Blocking & Parental Controls** – Implementing DNS-based filtering to **block unwanted sites & content**.  
✅ **WiFi Security Testing & Cracking (Ethical Assessment)** – Conducting **penetration tests** against my home network and extenders to identify vulnerabilities after earning my **Networking Certification**.  
✅ **Advanced network segmentation for better security** *(e.g., isolating IoT devices & guest networks)*  
✅ **Testing different firewall configurations & deep packet inspection (DPI) tuning**  
✅ **Exploring IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) for real-time security enforcement**  
✅ **Experimenting with cybersecurity tools in a controlled home lab environment**  

🚀 **More security optimizations coming soon!**
