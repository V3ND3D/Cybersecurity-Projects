# 🏠 Home Lab Setup  

This folder contains my **home network security projects**, configurations, and optimizations.  
I document how I **hardened my home network**, improved security protocols, and tested cybersecurity tools.  

## 🔹 Projects in This Folder:  

### 🔐 **Home Network Security Hardening (2025)**  
- Secured an **unsecured home network** using best security practices.  
- Implemented **WPA2-PSK encryption, MAC address filtering, and secure DNS settings**.  
- Configured **firewall rules, network segmentation, and access controls** for better security.  
- Improved **network monitoring and intrusion detection measures**.  

### 🛡 **Firewall & IDS Configurations**  
- Set up a **firewall to restrict unauthorized access** and reduce attack surfaces.  
- Implemented **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for monitoring potential threats**.  

### 📡 **Network Performance & Security Improvements**  
- Tuned **router settings to balance security and gaming performance**.  
- Analyzed **traffic logs for potential vulnerabilities**.  

## 🚀 **Future Additions:**  
✅ **VPN setup for secure remote access** *(Planned for future home network setup)*  
✅ **Advanced network segmentation for better security**  
✅ **Testing different firewall configurations**  
✅ **Experimenting with security tools in a controlled lab environment**  

More projects coming soon...
