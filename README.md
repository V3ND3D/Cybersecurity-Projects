Cybersecurity Projects

This repository showcases my cybersecurity projects, home lab experiments, security audits, and incident response reports. These projects demonstrate my hands-on experience with network security, system hardening, risk assessments, and penetration testing.

ðŸ”¹ Repository Overview

1. Security Audits & Risk Assessments
	â€¢	Contains security audits, risk assessments, and compliance evaluations for various environments.
	â€¢	Includes Botium Toys Security Audit (2025) with key findings and recommendations for security improvements.

2. Home Lab & Network Security
	â€¢	Documents my home network security hardening process, firewall configurations, and performance optimizations.
	â€¢	Includes:
	â€¢	Network segmentation, IDS implementation, and access control policies.
	â€¢	Secure DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) configuration.
	â€¢	Future additions: VPN setup, URL filtering, and advanced IPS testing.

3. Incident Response & Investigations (Coming Soon)
	â€¢	Reports on security incidents analyzed using network monitoring tools like tcpdump and Wireshark.
	â€¢	Example case: DNS service disruption due to port 53 inaccessibility, analyzed through ICMP error messages.
