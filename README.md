# 🔒 Cybersecurity Projects  

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Projects** repository. This collection showcases my hands-on experience in **network security, penetration testing, security audits, and incident response**. Each project focuses on applying cybersecurity principles to real-world scenarios, leveraging tools and frameworks used in professional environments.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 🏠 Home Lab & Network Security  
- **[Home Network Security Hardening](HomeLab-Network-Project.md)**  
  - Configured **firewalls, IDS, network segmentation, and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**.  
  - Enabled **MAC address filtering, WPA2-PSK encryption**, and best security practices.  
  - Conducted **penetration testing** on home lab devices.  

### 🛡️ Security Audits & Risk Assessments  
- **[Security Audits](Security-Audits/README.md)**  
  - **[Botium Toys Security Audit (2025)](Security-Audits/Botium-Toys/README.md)**  
  - Performed **risk assessments, compliance reviews, and vulnerability evaluations**.  
  - Identified **weak authentication policies, missing IDS, and weak encryption**.  

### 🚨 Incident Response & Forensic Analysis  
- **[Incident Reports](Incident-Response-Reports/README.md)**  
  - **[DNS Service Disruption Analysis](Incident-Response-Reports/Cybersecurity_Incident_Report.md)**  
  - Investigated a **DNS outage due to UDP port 53 being unreachable**.  
  - Captured network logs using **tcpdump** to analyze ICMP error responses.  
  - Proposed **root cause analysis and remediation steps**.  

### 🔍 Penetration Testing & Security Research  
- **(Upcoming) Web Application Pentesting**  
- **(Upcoming) Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**  

## 🔎 Skills Demonstrated  
✅ **Network Security & Hardening** (firewall configs, IDS, network segmentation)  
✅ **Incident Response & Forensics** (log analysis, root cause identification)  
✅ **Security Audits & Risk Management** (compliance checks, vulnerability assessments)  
✅ **Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking** (testing network and web security)  

## 📌 About This Repository  
This repository serves as a portfolio of my **practical cybersecurity experience**. Each project contains detailed documentation, configurations, and methodologies used. Future projects will expand into **SOC analysis, exploit development, and adversary emulation**.
