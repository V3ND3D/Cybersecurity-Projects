# DNS Incident Scenario

## Scenario Overview
You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT services for clients. Several customers reported that they were not able to access the client company's website, **www.yummyrecipesforme.com**, and encountered the error:

> "Destination port unreachable"

To troubleshoot the issue, you attempt to access the website yourself and receive the same error message. Using a network analyzer tool (`tcpdump`), you capture the network traffic while attempting to load the webpage.

## Network Traffic Analysis
Your browser sends a **DNS query (UDP request)** to a DNS server to resolve the domain name `yummyrecipesforme.com` to an IP address. After receiving the IP address, it should then send an **HTTPS request** to the web server to load the webpage. However, `tcpdump` logs reveal that the UDP packets sent to the DNS server result in **ICMP error messages** indicating:

> "udp port 53 unreachable."

```

## Analysis of the Logs
- The client at `192.51.100.15` sent a **DNS request (UDP)** to `203.0.113.2` for resolving `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
- The DNS server at `203.0.113.2` responded with **ICMP "udp port 53 unreachable"** errors.
- The issue repeated multiple times, confirming a **persistent problem**.

## Possible Causes
- **DNS server failure** – The DNS service at `203.0.113.2` is not running or is experiencing issues.
- **Firewall restrictions** – A firewall may be blocking port 53, preventing DNS resolution.
- **Misconfigured DNS settings** – The DNS server might be misconfigured, rejecting incoming requests.

## Next Steps
1. **Verify the DNS service status** on `203.0.113.2` to determine if it is running.
2. **Check firewall rules** to ensure that UDP port 53 is not being blocked.
3. **Switch to a backup DNS server** to test if the issue is specific to `203.0.113.2`.
4. **Perform a traceroute** to identify any network path issues preventing communication with the DNS server.
