# 🛠️ DNS Issue Incident Report

## 📌 Part 1: Summary of the Problem Found in the TCPDump Log

After analyzing network traffic logs, it was identified that DNS resolution failed due to repeated ICMP error messages indicating `udp port 53 unreachable.` The logs showed that each DNS query to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com` was met with an ICMP response, signaling that the destination port was unreachable.

### 📊 Network Traffic Analysis Details
- **Protocols Involved:** UDP (DNS Queries), ICMP (Error Responses)
- **Observed Behavior:** 
  - The system attempted multiple DNS queries to resolve `yummyrecipesforme.com` using UDP.
  - Each query was followed by an ICMP "port unreachable" message from the DNS server `203.0.113.2`, indicating that the request could not be processed.
  - The issue persisted across multiple retry attempts.

### 🔎 Interpretation of the Issue
The presence of "port unreachable" ICMP responses suggests that either:
- The DNS server at `203.0.113.2` is down or misconfigured.
- Firewall rules or network policies are blocking DNS queries.
- The DNS service is not running on the expected port.

## 🔍 Part 2: Analysis of the Data and Cause of the Incident

### 🕒 Time of Incident
The first recorded instance of the issue occurred at `13:24:32`, as seen in the timestamped logs.

### 📢 How the IT Team Became Aware of the Incident
The issue was first noticed when users reported being unable to access the website `yummyrecipesforme.com`. Troubleshooting efforts using `tcpdump` confirmed that DNS queries were failing, leading to the discovery of ICMP "port unreachable" messages.

### 🛠️ Actions Taken by the IT Team
- Ran `tcpdump` to analyze network traffic.
- Identified repeated UDP DNS queries that failed.
- Confirmed ICMP error messages indicating port 53 was unreachable.
- Checked firewall logs and network policies for any blocking rules.

### 🔑 Key Findings
- **Affected Service:** DNS resolution for `yummyrecipesforme.com`
- **Affected Port:** UDP 53
- **Error Type:** ICMP "port unreachable" messages
- **Potential Impact:** Users unable to resolve domain names, affecting web access.

### ⚠️ Likely Cause of the Incident
One or more of the following factors likely caused the issue:
- The DNS server at `203.0.113.2` was down or unresponsive.
- A firewall or network security rule was blocking outbound DNS queries.
- The DNS service was misconfigured or disabled on the target server.

### 🔧 Next Steps for Resolution
1. **Verify DNS Server Status** – Check if `203.0.113.2` is operational.
2. **Test Alternative DNS Servers** – Try resolving the domain using other public DNS servers (e.g., Google DNS `8.8.8.8`).
3. **Review Firewall Rules** – Ensure UDP port 53 is not being blocked.
4. **Check Server Logs** – Inspect logs on `203.0.113.2` for service errors.
5. **Restart DNS Services** – If necessary, restart the DNS service or reconfigure it.

### 🧐 Suspected Root Cause
The most probable cause is a DNS service failure at `203.0.113.2`, preventing domain name resolution. Secondary possibilities include firewall restrictions or network misconfigurations.
